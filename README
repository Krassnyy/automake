Reference to the thread kicking off this project:

 "Could automake-generated Makefiles required GNU make?"
 <http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/automake/2011-11/msg00017.html>

with partial consensus reached here:

 <http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/automake/2011-11/msg00088.htm>

The discussion continued also in a thread on the gnu-prog-discuss list,
which unfortunately is a private list dedicated to GNU maintainers, and
thus for which no public archive is available.  The title of the thread
was "Automire: a non-hostile forking of GNU automake", and it was started
by me (Stefano Lattarini) on 2011-12-01.

-*-*-

The name "Automake-NG" for this automake variant has two reasons, which
are motivated by two apparently incompatible (but in fact only orthogonal)
concerns:

  1. Paolo Bonzini pointed out that a backward-incompatible (even if only
     partly so) "Automake 2" might propagate the past bad reputation of
     the autotools w.r.t. backward-incompatibility.  So the new project
     should be a fork of automake, with a name of its own.  I proposed
     "Automire" as the name, to give credit to the Quagmire attempt,
     while retaining the `am' namespace.  But then ...

  2. Stefan Monnier noted (on the non-public gnu-prog-discuss list):

     ``From where I stand, if you want the product to be successful,
       you'll want its heritage to be very clear from the name.  To me
       "automire" doesn't remind of "automake" at all.  To someone aware
       of Quagmire, it may sound like "automatically mired in Quagmire's
       problems".   I understand that if Automake is still live on, yours
       can't just be "Automake 3.0", but it can be "automake-ng"''

    to which I (Stefano Lattarini) replied:

    ``You might be right about this, especially considering that the new
      project is planned to have two phases, in the first one of which it
      will remain very similar to automake in APIs and features (and,
      sadly, limitations).  And `automake-ng' sounds like a good name
      -- "ng" as in "New Generation", or more modestly, as in "Needs
      GNUmake" ;-)''

  OK ... [SNIP] ... I mostly agree with you about this (but for the name
  of the project, that is), at least as a first step.  Let me state my
  plan in more precise terms (and sorry for not having done it before):

   1. First, we start refactoring the automake codebase to transform
      it into "Automake-NG": a mostly Automake-compatible software, with
      only marginal or minor changes in APIs, that shares a lot of code
      and design with Automake, but whose generated Makefiles require GNU
      make.  See also point [3] at:
        <http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/automake/2011-01/msg00077.html>
      Automake-NG will, where feasible, take advantage of GNU make features
      to simplify its internals and implementation, but this will hardly
      offer a better user experience for Makefile.am writers.  See also
      sensible Ralf's observations at:
        <http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/automake/2011-01/msg00053.html>

   2. If Automake-NG has been successful, we might proceed to develop
      "Automire": a more agressive rewrite, with profound APIs, design
      and code changes, in the hope of making automire easier to use and
      to extend (lack of extensibility on part of the user is probably
      one of the greatest shortcoming of the current automake).

  And even if we fail to finally develop Automire, I believe that
  Automake-NG will still be by itself a worth and useful step forward.

  > Presumably it will have plenty of user-level benefits, too, and not
  > just a cleaner implementation.

===========================================================================

This is Automake, a Makefile generator.  It was inspired by the 4.4BSD
make and include files, but it only targets GNU make, and it aims to
conform to the GNU Coding Standards for Makefile variables and targets.

Automake is a Perl script.  The input files are called Makefile.am.
The output files are called Makefile.in; they are intended for use
with Autoconf.  Automake requires certain things to be done in your
configure.ac.

Variable assignment lines in Makefile.am pull in defaults from various
little *.am files.

To use Automake, replace your Makefile.in files with Makefile.am
files.  Read the documentation to see what to do.

This package also includes the "aclocal" program.  aclocal is a
program to generate an `aclocal.m4' based on the contents of
`configure.ac'.  It is useful as an extensible, maintainable mechanism
for augmenting autoconf.  It is intended that other package authors
will write m4 macros which can be automatically used by aclocal.

Automake has a test suite.  Use

	make check

to run it.  Capture its output in case of failing tests.  For more
information, please see the file tests/README.

Automake has a page on the web.  See:

	http://sources.redhat.com/automake/

The mailing list automake@gnu.org is for discussion of Automake and
its interactions with other configuration/portability tools like
Autoconf or Libtool.  Write to automake-request@gnu.org if you want to
join.

Mail suggestions and bug reports to bug-automake@gnu.org, patches
to automake-patches@gnu.org.

New releases are announced to autotools-announce@gnu.org.  Write to
autotools-announce-request@gnu.org if you want to receive them.
